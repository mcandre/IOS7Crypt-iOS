# ABOUT

IOS7Crypt encrypts and decrypts passwords using Cisco's weak algorithm from old network routers era Cisco IOSv7. [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk59/technologies_tech_note09186a00809d38a7.shtml) has since acknowledged the insecurity of its algorithm, recommending stronger hash algorithms such as MD5. IOS7Crypt serves as a tool for computer science teachers demonstrating a practical, if behind the times, lesson on cryptology techniques.

The encryption algorithm has been implemented in multiple programming languages, and ported to different platforms, including CLI, GUI, desktop, and mobile, to aid students with varying degrees of familiarity with languages and/or computer hardware.
